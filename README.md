# Web-Scraper
Scrape data from Newegg.com

How to use:
Line 21: Has the URL, so if you want to scrape a different page from Newegg, just copy and paste into the var myURL.

This program is not ambigious and will not work outside the Newegg website, but if you want to scrape a different website fill in the parameters in lines 48-53 with what you would like to scrape. (This can be found through the HTML of the page)
